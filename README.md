Use this utility to delete duplicate files in a directory.

Simply run the latest jar file from the [releases page](https://github.com/Trophonix/RemoveDuplicates/releases) in the directory you want to scan!

If you want to see which files it's deleting as it works, run it from a command line using `java -jar FILENAME.jar` and it will begin to print output to the command line. A GUI may be added in future versions.

Enjoy!
